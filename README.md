Welcome to PodsForSquads!

Intro:
Hello and welcome to pods for squads! We are a web app that is a resource to find and create a playlist and conspire with other playlists based on podcasts. Our goal is to make a welcoming environment for new users and people new to the podcast realm. We want everyone to find and enjoy these beloved videos people make, and sometimes that can be hard considering how much this has blown up in the last few years. Now there is no need to worry.  

Features:
In our website, users will be able to sign up and make an account and customize their profile. From there, the home menu will be set up in a catalog format and the users will be able to select from the offers provided there, or use the search bar if they have a name of a podcast they are interested in. From there, users will be able to preview and get a brief description of the podcast and the episode to see if it interests them. Then, the user will be able to create a playlist and share those with other users on the platform.  

Tech:
In website development, we used VSC (Visual Studio COde) as the IDE to code and build our website in, and for the APIs, we are using ListenNotes and we are using Google Firebase to control and manage data collection. 

Installation:
	To test and work on our website, you will need to download this zip file from github. From there, open it up and fire it up on your computer. This should be a PC only website. 

Dev Setup:
	For initial start up on the website, you only need an IDE that can use HTML, Javascript, and CSS which we recommend you use VSC and just install all the add ons in the extension part of the IDE. This will work on your localhost and Wifi or internet in general should not be required, the only time it would be required is fi you need to update or download an IDE to use the actual code on.
